# Login / Registration Page
Since my coding learning is too slow (I took too much everything), I arranged a personal coding marathon for a whole week. The main goal - do one project per day from 28.06.2023 to 04.07.2023.
<br />
This is my third project in this marathon - Login / Registration Page. As I said in the project description, it's a very simple React project where I didn't use anything special, like a backend or API. I thought about adding validation for inputs, but I spent so much time on this one, I am tired. Sorry.
